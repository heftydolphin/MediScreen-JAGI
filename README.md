# MediScreen-JAGI
A repository used by JAGI team to develop a system including a website, a mobile application and AI models.

PROJECT SCOPE:
●	Develop a website that’s users are GP’s and insurance professionals which stores patient records and enables insurers to make
  decisions about insurance plans and medical professionals to give advice, based on patients’ risk profiles. 
●	Develop a mobile application to be used by clients of the insurance company that enables them to calculate the likelihood of
  contracting hearth disease and/or diabetes based on their lifestyle and previous medical history.
●	Develop, using machine learning and publicly available datasets, an AI interface for the mobile application and website, that 
  will determine whether a patient needs to be tested for the prediction of the likelihood of them contracting hearth disease 
  and/or diabetes based on the patients’ risk profile and then calculate if necessary.
  
PURPOSE:
The system as a whole is a mutually beneficial project. Its primary purpose is for an international healthcare insurance company to
better predict the likelihood of their clients contracting hearth disease and diabetes in order to give higher rates of insurance plans.
This is also beneficial to the clients as if they know they are of high risk of contracting such conditions, they can change their 
lifestyle in a way to prevent it from happening. It is also beneficial for the GP’s as It gives a platform for them to communicate and
advise their patients.
